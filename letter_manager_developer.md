Hey <name>,

I saw your ad for the position of <position> at <company> and I think it would be a good fit with my expertise and what I am looking for from my next positions.

In my current position as head of full-stack engineering for a global dating app, I am in charge of planning new features, proposals for the CTO, sprint planning and retros, mentoring junior developers and contributing hands on to the codebase as part of the day to day operations.

I am convinced that I would be a good asset for your organization and I could hit the ground running in no time.

Are you interested in scheduling a catch-up call this week?

Thank you,
Mihai Blebea
